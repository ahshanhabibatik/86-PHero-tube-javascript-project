        <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Question: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <h1 class="font-bold">What is var?</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, var is a keyword used to declare variables. It was the primary way to
            declare variables in
            JavaScript prior to the introduction of let and const in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).</p>
        <ul>
            <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Var Scope:</h1>
            <li>Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, depending on where they are declared.
            </li>
            <li>If a variable is declared within a function using var, it is accessible within that function and any
                nested
                functions.</li>
            <li>If a variable is declared outside of any function using var, it becomes a global variable and is
                accessible
                throughout the entire script.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-xl font-extrabold">Example of Var</p>

        <p>
            var message = "Hello, World!"; <br>
            console.log(message);
        </p>

    <!-- let -->
    <article>
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">What is let?</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, let is a keyword used to declare variables. It was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and
            provides a more modern and flexible way to declare variables compared to the older var keyword.</p>
        <ul>
            <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Let Scope:</h1>
            <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the
                block (enclosed within curly braces) in which they are defined. This includes blocks within functions,
                loops, and conditional statements.
            </li>
            <li>No Hoisting Issues: Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their
                containing scope. They are only accessible after the point at which they are declared.</li>
            <li>No Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a variable with the same name within the same block scope.
                Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-xl font-extrabold">Example of let</p>

        <p>
            function exampleFunction() { <br>
            let message = "Hello, World!"; <br>
            console.log(message);
            }

            exampleFunction();
        </p>

    <article>
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">What is const?</h1>
        <p class="justify-between">
            In JavaScript, const is a keyword used to declare variables that have a constant, unchangeable value. Once a
            variable is declared with const and assigned a value, that value cannot be reassigned or changed throughout
            the program's execution.</p>
        <ul>
            <h1 class="font-bold">Const Scope:</h1>
            <li>Constant Value: Variables declared with const are used for values that should not change. Once a value
                is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be modified or reassigned.
            </li>
            <li>Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped, which means their scope is
                limited to the block (enclosed within curly braces) in which they are defined.</li>
            <li>Must Be Assigned: When declaring a variable with const, you must assign a value to it at the time of
                declaration. Unlike let, you cannot declare a const variable without initializing it.</li>
            <li>No Re-assignment: Attempts to reassign a const variable will result in a syntax error.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-xl font-extrabold">Example of const</p>

        <p>
            const pi = 3.14159; <br>
            pi = 3.14; <br>

            if (true) { <br>
            const message = "Hello"; <br>
            console.log(message); <br>
            } <br>

            console.log(message);

        <h1 class="font-bold">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p class="font-bold">1.null:</p>

        <li>null is a deliberate value that represents the absence of any object or value.</li>
        <li>It is often used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object should have no value.</li>
        <li>Initializing a variable before assigning it a meaningful value.</li>
        <li>Clearing or resetting the value of a variable or object.</li>
        <li>Checking for the absence of an object or value.</li>

        <div>
            <p class="font-bold">1.undefined</p>
            <li>undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value</li>
            <li>It is also the default value of function parameters that are not provided with an argument.</li>
            <li>Variables declared but not yet assigned a value.</li>
            <li>Function parameters that have not been provided with arguments.</li>
            <li>Variables or properties that do not exist.</li>
        </div>

        <h1 class="font-bold">What do you mean by rest API? </h1>
        <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) in JavaScript refers to a web
            service or endpoint that follows the principles of REST, a set of architectural constraints for designing
            networked applications. JavaScript can be used to interact with REST APIs, making HTTP requests to retrieve
            or send data between a client (typically a web browser or application) and a server.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Here's a breakdown of some key concepts related to REST APIs in JavaScript:</p>

        <p><span class="font-bold">REST: </span>REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for
            creating web services. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication model where resources (such as
            data objects) are represented as URLs, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are used to perform
            CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these resources.</p>

        <p><span class="font-bold">API: </span>An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and
            protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of web
            development, an API typically refers to a set of endpoints on a web server that can be accessed by client
            applications to perform various operations.</p>
